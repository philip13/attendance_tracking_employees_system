## Work Estimation:
```   
   3 pt Estimate = ( expected  *4 + best_case  +  worst_case)/6
   I use hours to this estimation

    Story Poins Units in this case is as points of difficulty TODO
    I take the Fibonacci scale as point of difficulty 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ...
    For example the difficulty of the story can be:

    * 1 point (small diffyculty)
    * 3 points (medium difficulty)
    * 5 points (large difficulty)
```
